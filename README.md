[Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong "Wikipedia on Pong") is an
age old arcade game.

Frameworks
----------

The following frameworks are demonstrated in this project.

* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/ "Jasmine GitHub documentation page")
  is used to provide an test framework.
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/ "Backbone documentation page")
  is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework which will decouple the
  domain from the different representation.

We will be using [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/ "Homepage for
